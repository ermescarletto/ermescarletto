## 🦕 About Me

I'm a seasoned developer with experience ranging from ancient C code to modern frameworks like React and Flutter. I’ve seen it all—from the extinction of floppy disks to the rise of cloud computing. My journey has taken me through various programming languages and tools, always striving to stay ahead of the curve (or at least not get hit by the latest "meteor" 🪐).

When I’m not coding, you can find me tinkering with new tech, digging into data, or dodging the latest Scrum "meteor" that’s trying to wipe me out!
